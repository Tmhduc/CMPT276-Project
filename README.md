# What is the name of your web application?
Multi Brand Sampling Sign-up Forum

The client is currently manually inputting data from google forms to Connecteam to schedule their employees for brand sampling and is interested in optimizing this process.
Our project would mainly cater towards brands willing to work and partner with our client’s company to simplify and efficiently market their consumer goods in a variety of stores across BC.
The webapp will include a login and signup for potential brand partners, and allow them to create and view forms to schedule a sampling booth with detailed instructions for the sampling employees,
as well as allowing brands to track the status of their product sample. This may involve identifying and reporting potential conflicts.
Whenever a scheduled sampling booth fills up with brands that schedule will automatically be created on Connecteam and have an email sent out to possible stores for sampling.

# What is the scope of your project? Does this project have many individual features or one main feature (a possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.

The project involves solving one primary problem: automation and optimization of a company’s digital workflow.
This will involve building up to an overall solution by automating and optimizing all the distinct workflows of the company’s day-to-day operations,
such as brand sign-up, data organization, efficient time-conflict resolution, automated notifications, as well as location and employee scheduling.
A massive part of this will likely involve an automated spreadsheet (currently the client manually uses Google sheets), the implementation of which will almost certainly involve the use of a database.

# What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user of your site, what types of things can I do? These are the ‘stories’ of your project.

Suppose you are running a food business, and you have a new product you’d like to advertise. You may sign up for a business account with our client’s service.
You may then sign up for a sampling slot, providing details like specific stores for sampling, as well as specifying potential conflicts with other brands,
or even providing special requests or requirements regarding the presentation of the product (such as a need for a hot plate, which results in an increased cost).
Once a sampling “order” has been accepted by our client, you will be notified, and our client will run sample tables at various stores around the lower mainland according to your specifications.

# Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?

Given the potential complexity of organizing the (surprisingly) large volume of complex data present in this company’s current workflow, we believe there is plenty for each group member to aptly contribute.
